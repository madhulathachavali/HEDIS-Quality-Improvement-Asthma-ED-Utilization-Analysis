# ðŸ“Š HEDIS-Quality-Improvement-Asthma-ED-Utilization-Analysis

**Data Source:** MIMIC-III Clinical Database obtained via Physionet using Bigquery 

**Project Summary:**
This project utilizes MIMIC-IV emergency department (ED) data to analyze frequent ED visits among asthma patients, in alignment with the HEDIS measure EDU (ED Utilization for Asthma). The dataset consists of 19,223 records and 16 features, providing a detailed view of asthma-related ED utilization patterns. The primary focus is on developing patient risk stratification based on factors such as:

- ED Length of Stay (LOS)

- Comorbidities (including diabetes, hypertension, COPD)

- Total ED visits

### Project Goals:

* Stratify asthma patients by ED utilization risk and evaluate care disparities.
* Summarize comorbidity burden and examine its relationship with ED utilization.
* Provide insights into how ED LOS and acuity metrics correlate with patient risk levels.

### Methodology

#### 1. Data Extraction & Preprocessing

- Queried MIMIC-IV edstays, diagnoses_icd, patients, and admissions tables via BigQuery.

- Filtered for asthma patients using ICD-9 codes starting with J45.

- Merged patient-level features including demographics, diagnosis codes, and comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, COPD).

#### 2. Feature Engineering

- Generated frequent_ed_user flag (â‰¥4 ED visits per patient).

- Bucketed ed_los_hours into clinically relevant categories: <2h, 2-4h, 4-8h, 8-12h, >12h.

- Counted total ED visits and comorbidities for each patient.

#### 3. Descriptive & Comparative Analysis

- Calculated prevalence of comorbidities across LOS categories and ED visit frequency.

- Explored patient demographics (race, gender) to assess equity in ED usage.

- Aggregated acuity scores and LOS by risk levels.

#### 4. Visualization

- Created bar charts, pie charts, and comparative plots using Pythonâ€™s matplotlib and seaborn to highlight disparities and utilization patterns.

- Constructed cross-tabulations to show the distribution of frequent ED use across LOS and comorbidity strata.

#### 5. HEDIS Measure Alignment

- Mapped findings to HEDIS EDU criteria, focusing on actionable insights for care quality improvement and population health management.

### Results:

* **Comorbidity Prevalence in Asthma ED Visits:**

  * Diabetes: 26.85%

| **Frequent ED Users**               | 93% of patients (17,881 out of 19,223) are frequent ED users (â‰¥4 visits).                |
| **ED Length of Stay Distribution**  | 46% of visits lasted 4â€“8 hours. 3.6% were under 2 hours.                        |

| **Risk Stratification**          | HEDIS improvement requires targeting high-risk patients            | Segments patients by ED use, LOS, and comorbidities to prioritize high-risk groups for outreach and intervention.                   |
| **Actionable Metrics**           | Measures must be clear, monitorable, and linked to outcomes        | Defines `frequent_ed_user`, `ed_los_category`, and `comorbidity_count` for use in quality monitoring.                   |

### Conclusion:

This project successfully identifies frequent ED users among asthma patients, correlating ED utilization patterns with comorbidities and patient demographics. Interventions should include frequent follow-up after ED visits, management of comorbidities, and education on recognizing signs that lead to severe conditions. By implementing these strategies, healthcare providers can improve asthma management, reduce unnecessary ED visits, and enhance patient outcomes, particularly for high-risk groups
